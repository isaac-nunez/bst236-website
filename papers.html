                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kate Sanders, Benjamin Van Durme</p>
                    <p>  To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI
systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with
uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models
demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these
criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty
awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning
system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant
grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived
from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable
at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of
varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and
databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that
Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while
generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.

                    <h3>The Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Annihilating Domain Walls</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alessio Notari, Fabrizio Rompineve, Francisco Torrenti</p>
                    <p>  Networks of cosmic domain walls can form in the early Universe as a
consequence of the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries. We study the
production of a cosmological background of gravitational waves (GWs) from such
networks, when they annihilate due to a small explicit symmetry breaking term.
Averaging over several 3+1-dimensional high-resolution lattice field
simulations, we obtain a GW spectrum with the following characteristics: (1) a
broad asymmetric peak, roughly located at frequency $f\sim 2 H_{\rm gw}$, where
$H_{\rm gw}$ is the Hubble rate at the end of GW production, shortly after
annihilation, (2) a doubly broken power spectrum $\propto k^{-n}$, with initial
slope $n \sim 0.5$ after the main peak and $n \sim 1.8$ at high $f$, while the
low frequency region $f<f_p$ agrees with the causality behavior $\sim k^3$.
Additionally, extending previous results, we find that GW production continues
to be efficient until a value of the Hubble scale $H_{\text gw}$ that is
roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the naive estimate $\sigma H =
\Delta V$, where $\sigma$ is the wall tension and $\Delta V$ the size of the
symmetry breaking term, thereby leading to a $O(100)$ larger GW signal. We find
such results to be robust when changing the shape of the scalar field potential
or including a time-dependent symmetry breaking term. Our findings have
important implications for GW searches, especially in light of the reported
evidence for a stochastic GW background in Pulsar Timing Array data.

                    <h3>Do Larger Language Models Imply Better Reasoning? A Pretraining Scaling
  Law for Reasoning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xinyi Wang, Shawn Tan, Mingyu Jin, William Yang Wang, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen</p>
                    <p>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks requiring complex reasoning. However, the effects of
scaling on their reasoning abilities remain insufficiently understood. In this
paper, we introduce a synthetic multihop reasoning environment designed to
closely replicate the structure and distribution of real-world large-scale
knowledge graphs. Our reasoning task involves completing missing edges in the
graph, which requires advanced multi-hop reasoning and mimics real-world
reasoning scenarios. To evaluate this, we pretrain language models (LMs) from
scratch solely on triples from the incomplete graph and assess their ability to
infer the missing edges. Interestingly, we observe that overparameterization
can impair reasoning performance due to excessive memorization. We investigate
different factors that affect this U-shaped loss curve, including graph
structure, model size, and training steps. To predict the optimal model size
for a specific knowledge graph, we find an empirical scaling that linearly maps
the knowledge graph search entropy to the optimal model size. This work
provides new insights into the relationship between scaling and reasoning in
LLMs, shedding light on possible ways to optimize their performance for
reasoning tasks.

                    <h3>Enhancing Causal Effect Estimation with Diffusion-Generated Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li Chen, Xiaotong Shen, Wei Pan</p>
                    <p>  Estimating causal effects from observational data is inherently challenging
due to the lack of observable counterfactual outcomes and even the presence of
unmeasured confounding. Traditional methods often rely on restrictive,
untestable assumptions or necessitate valid instrumental variables,
significantly limiting their applicability and robustness. In this paper, we
introduce Augmented Causal Effect Estimation (ACEE), an innovative approach
that utilizes synthetic data generated by a diffusion model to enhance causal
effect estimation. By fine-tuning pre-trained generative models, ACEE simulates
counterfactual scenarios that are otherwise unobservable, facilitating accurate
estimation of individual and average treatment effects even under unmeasured
confounding. Unlike conventional methods, ACEE relaxes the stringent
unconfoundedness assumption, relying instead on an empirically checkable
condition. Additionally, a bias-correction mechanism is introduced to mitigate
synthetic data inaccuracies. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating
the consistency and efficiency of the ACEE estimator, alongside comprehensive
empirical validation through simulation studies and benchmark datasets. Results
confirm that ACEE significantly improves causal estimation accuracy,
particularly in complex settings characterized by nonlinear relationships and
heteroscedastic noise.

                    <p>  As inference-time scaling becomes critical for enhanced reasoning
capabilities, it is increasingly becoming important to build models that are
efficient to infer. We introduce Nemotron-H, a family of 8B and 56B/47B hybrid
Mamba-Transformer models designed to reduce inference cost for a given accuracy
level. To achieve this goal, we replace the majority of self-attention layers
in the common Transformer model architecture with Mamba layers that perform
constant computation and require constant memory per generated token. We show
that Nemotron-H models offer either better or on-par accuracy compared to other
similarly-sized state-of-the-art open-sourced Transformer models (e.g.,
Qwen-2.5-7B/72B and Llama-3.1-8B/70B), while being up to 3$\times$ faster at
inference. To further increase inference speed and reduce the memory required
at inference time, we created Nemotron-H-47B-Base from the 56B model using a
new compression via pruning and distillation technique called MiniPuzzle.
Nemotron-H-47B-Base achieves similar accuracy to the 56B model, but is 20%
faster to infer. In addition, we introduce an FP8-based training recipe and
show that it can achieve on par results with BF16-based training. This recipe
is used to train the 56B model. All Nemotron-H models will be released, with
support in Hugging Face, NeMo, and Megatron-LM.

                    <h3>AIR: A Systematic Analysis of Annotations, Instructions, and Response
  Pairs in Preference Dataset</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Bingxiang He, Wenbin Zhang, Jiaxi Song, Cheng Qian, Zixuan Fu, Bowen Sun, Ning Ding, Haiwen Hong, Longtao Huang, Hui Xue, Ganqu Cui, Wanxiang Che, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun</p>
                    <p>  Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values, yet its success hinges on high-quality datasets comprising
three core components: Preference \textbf{A}nnotations, \textbf{I}nstructions,
and \textbf{R}esponse Pairs. Current approaches conflate these components,
obscuring their individual impacts and hindering systematic optimization. In
this work, we propose \textbf{AIR}, a component-wise analysis framework that
systematically isolates and optimizes each component while evaluating their
synergistic effects. Through rigorous experimentation, AIR reveals actionable
principles: annotation simplicity (point-wise generative scoring), instruction
inference stability (variance-based filtering across LLMs), and response pair
quality (moderate margins + high absolute scores). When combined, these
principles yield +5.3 average gains over baseline method, even with only 14k
high-quality pairs. Our work shifts preference dataset design from ad hoc
scaling to component-aware optimization, offering a blueprint for efficient,
reproducible alignment.

                    <h3>Scalable Hypergraph Structure Learning with Diverse Smoothness Priors</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin T. Brown, Haoxiang Zhang, Daniel L. Lau, Gonzalo R. Arce</p>
                    <p>  In graph signal processing, learning the weighted connections between nodes
from a set of sample signals is a fundamental task when the underlying
relationships are not known a priori. This task is typically addressed by
finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the
extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two
nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs.
However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has
led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing
approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through
generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations,
subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To
this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a
hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our
approach addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection
and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization
solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed
convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits
the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set.
In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network
structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms
of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods;
furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation
terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.

                    <h3>Coupling hydrodynamics with comoving frame radiative transfer. III. The
  wind regime of early-type B hypergiants</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> M. Bernini-Peron, A. A. C. Sander, F. Najarro, G. N. Sabhahit, D. Pauli, R. R. Lefever, J. S. Vink, V. Ramachandran, L. M. Oskinova, G. González-Torà, E. C. Schösser</p>
                    <p>  Context. B hypergiants (BHGs) are important for understanding high-mass
stellar evolution. While they are in a similar parameter space of B supergiants
(BSGs), some BHGs are known to be luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their spectra
with absorption and emission features resemble Of/WNh stars. Yet, their wind
physics and their evolutionary connections are not clear. Aims. In this study,
we aim to understand (i) the atmospheric and wind structure, (ii) the
wind-launching and -driving mechanisms, and (iii) the spectrum formation of
early-type BHGs. As an observational prototype, we use zet1 Sco (B1.5Ia+).
Methods. Using the atmosphere code PoWRhd, we calculated the first
hydrodynamically consistent models at the BHG domain. They give insights into
the radiative driving of the calculated wind regimes and enable us to study the
influence of clumping and X-rays on the resulting wind structure. Results. Our
consistent model reproduces the main spectral features of zet1 Sco. The
obtained mass-loss rate is higher than that of similar spectral type BSGs.
However, the wind optical depth of BHGs is way below unity, making them less of
a transition type. To reproduce zet1 Sco's spectrum, we needed low clumping
with subsonic onset. The wind has a shallow-gradient velocity profile,
deviating from the beta law, and is mainly driven by Fe III opacity.
Conclusions. Our study suggests that despite more mass loss, early-type
Galactic BHGs have winds relatively similar to BSGs. Their winds are not thick
enough to characterize them as "transition-type" stars, unlike Of/WNh, implying
that emission features arise more easily in cooler than in hotter stars. The
spectral BHG appearance is likely connected to atmospheric inhomogeneities
below the sonic point. To reach an appearance similar to LBVs, BHGs need to be
either closer to the Eddington limit or have higher wind clumping than inferred
for zeta1 Sco.

                    <h3>Intracluster light is a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution in
  clusters</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> J. Butler, G. Martin, N. A. Hatch, F. Pearce, S. Brough, Y. Dubois</p>
                    <p>  The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light
(ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter
(DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how
the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM
distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with
$M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN
simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean
specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity
is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst
the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only
marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower
${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is
robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is
concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies,
where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have
velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more
centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that
intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating
these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates
that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a
biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer
properties of the DM from the ICL.

                    <h3>A framework for computing upper bounds in passive learning settings</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Benjamin Bordais, Daniel Neider</p>
                    <p>  The task of inferring logical formulas from examples has garnered significant
attention as a means to assist engineers in creating formal specifications used
in the design, synthesis, and verification of computing systems. Among various
approaches, enumeration algorithms have emerged as some of the most effective
techniques for this task. These algorithms employ advanced strategies to
systematically enumerate candidate formulas while minimizing redundancies by
avoiding the generation of syntactically different but semantically equivalent
formulas. However, a notable drawback is that these algorithms typically do not
provide guarantees of termination, which poses challenges for their use in
real-world applications.
  This paper develops an abstract framework to bound the size of possible
solutions for a logic inference task, thereby providing a termination guarantee
for enumeration algorithms through the introduction of a sufficient stopping
criterion. The proposed framework is designed with flexibility in mind and is
applicable to a broad spectrum of practically relevant logical formalisms,
including Modal Logic, Linear Temporal Logic, Computation Tree Logic,
Alternating-time Temporal Logic, and even selected inference task for finite
automata. In addition, our approach enabled us to develop a new class of
algorithms that enumerate over the semantics of formulas rather than their
syntactic representations, offering new possibilities for reducing redundancy.
