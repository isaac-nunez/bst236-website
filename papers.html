                    <h3>Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation
  Transplant</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinqi Luo, Tianjiao Ding, Kwan Ho Ryan Chan, Hancheng Min, Chris Callison-Burch, René Vidal</p>
                    <p>  Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing
methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an
edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure
faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual
consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each
source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to
search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this
challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play
framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image
editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text
embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the
representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately
estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based
on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept
transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To
sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation
dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of
visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple
diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan
achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency
preservation.

                    <h3>Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual
  Editing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xiangyu Zhao, Peiyuan Zhang, Kexian Tang, Hao Li, Zicheng Zhang, Guangtao Zhai, Junchi Yan, Hua Yang, Xue Yang, Haodong Duan</p>
                    <p>  Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual
understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual
Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance
consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we
introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed
viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal,
Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for
each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction
Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human
judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while
GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary
models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning
tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort,
RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual
editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we
are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support
more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation
multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.

  outflowing circumnuclear disk of NGC1068</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yuze Zhang, Serena Viti, Santiago García-Burillo, Ko-Yun Huang</p>
                    <p>  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) influence their host galaxies through winds and
jets that can drive molecular outflows, traceable with CO line emissions using
the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). Recent studies leveraging ALMA data
have proposed a three-dimensional outflow geometry in the nearby Seyfert II
galaxy NGC 1068, a key target for AGN unification theories. Using ALMA
observations of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), and CO(6-5) transitions at roughly 0.1
arcseconds (approximately 7 parsecs) resolution, we analyzed the temperature,
density, and kinematics of NGC 1068's circumnuclear disk (CND), focusing on the
molecular outflow. Through local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we
derived column densities and rotational temperatures, indicating optically thin
gas and CO-to-H2 (XCO) conversion factors between 4.8 and 9.6 times smaller
than the Milky Way value. The inferred molecular mass outflow rate is mostly
below 5.5 solar masses per year, with the dominant contribution northeast of
the AGN. After subtracting the rotation curve of the CND, we modeled averaged
line profiles in each region using single and multi-component Gaussian fits.
Several profiles within or near the AGN wind bicone required multiple
components with significant velocity shifts, suggesting multi-component complex
outflow kinematics. We observe lateral variation in CO kinematics along the AGN
wind bicone and a misalignment between the molecular and ionized outflow
directions. These results imply that the dynamic impact of the ionized AGN wind
on the molecular gas in the CND may be limited. However, the molecular outflow
shows a complex, asymmetric structure.

                    <h3>Echoes of the hidden: Uncovering coordination beyond network structure</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shahar Somin, Tom Cohen, Jeremy Kepner, Alex Pentland</p>
                    <p>  The study of connectivity and coordination has drawn increasing attention in
recent decades due to their central role in driving markets, shaping societal
dynamics, and influencing biological systems. Traditionally, observable
connections, such as phone calls, financial transactions, or social media
connections, have been used to infer coordination and connectivity. However,
incomplete, encrypted, or fragmented data, alongside the ubiquity of
communication platforms and deliberate obfuscation, often leave many real-world
connections hidden. In this study, we demonstrate that coordinating individuals
exhibit shared bursty activity patterns, enabling their detection even when
observable links between them are sparse or entirely absent. We further propose
a generative model based on the network of networks formalism to account for
the mechanisms driving this collaborative burstiness, attributing it to shock
propagation across networks rather than isolated individual behavior. Model
simulations demonstrate that when observable connection density is below 70\%,
burstiness significantly improves coordination detection compared to
state-of-the-art temporal and structural methods. This work provides a new
perspective on community and coordination dynamics, advancing both theoretical
understanding and practical detection. By laying the foundation for identifying
hidden connections beyond observable network structures, it enables detection
across different platforms, alongside enhancing system behavior understanding,
informed decision-making, and risk mitigation.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Pradyumn Goyal, Dmitry Petrov, Sheldon Andrews, Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu, Evangelos Kalogerakis</p>
                    <p>  We present GEOPARD, a transformer-based architecture for predicting
articulation from a single static snapshot of a 3D shape. The key idea of our
method is a pretraining strategy that allows our transformer to learn plausible
candidate articulations for 3D shapes based on a geometric-driven search
without manual articulation annotation. The search automatically discovers
physically valid part motions that do not cause detachments or collisions with
other shape parts. Our experiments indicate that this geometric pretraining
strategy, along with carefully designed choices in our transformer
architecture, yields state-of-the-art results in articulation inference in the
PartNet-Mobility dataset.

                    <h3>Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under
  Information Asymmetry</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Aneesh Raghavan, M. Umar B. Niazi, Karl H. Johansson</p>
                    <p>  This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent
systems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information.
Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to
correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and
accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their
beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts
before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more
information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share
information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves
equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs;
(2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for
belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their
counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence
threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional
probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents
with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive
advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing --
despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared
to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of
communication even in this competitive setup.

  constant in the self-consistent Born approximation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Giacomo Morpurgo, Christophe Berthod, Thierry Giamarchi</p>
                    <p>  The dc conductivity tensor of two-dimensional one-band metals with weak
pointlike disorder and magnetic field is studied in the self-consistent Born
approximation, with special emphasis on the regime of low carrier density. In
this theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion
and local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal
functional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed
expressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature
in the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal
exponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied
numerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may
be relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the
metallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.

                    <h3>ERPO: Advancing Safety Alignment via Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference
  Optimization</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kehua Feng, Keyan Ding, Jing Yu, Menghan Li, Yuhao Wang, Tong Xu, Xinda Wang, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen</p>
                    <p>  Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, yet their potential to generate harmful
content poses critical safety challenges. Existing alignment methods often
struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. In this work, we propose Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization
(ERPO), a novel safety alignment framework that equips LLMs with explicit
preemptive reasoning through Chain-of-Thought and provides clear evidence for
safety judgments by embedding predefined safety rules. Specifically, our
approach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante
reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning
module; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a
length-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy. Experiments on
multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that ERPO significantly enhances safety
performance while maintaining response efficiency.

                    <h3>Learning Phase Distortion with Selective State Space Models for Video
  Turbulence Mitigation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Xingguang Zhang, Nicholas Chimitt, Xijun Wang, Yu Yuan, Stanley H. Chan</p>
                    <p>  Atmospheric turbulence is a major source of image degradation in long-range
imaging systems. Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation
(TM) methods have been proposed, many are slow, memory-hungry, and do not
generalize well. In the spatial domain, methods based on convolutional
operators have a limited receptive field, so they cannot handle a large spatial
dependency required by turbulence. In the temporal domain, methods relying on
self-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but
their quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames.
Traditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges.
  In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A
turbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model
(MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across
spatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational
complexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state
space model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase
distortion, the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence,
significantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by
reducing the ill-posedness. Our proposed method exceeds current
state-of-the-art networks on various synthetic and real-world TM benchmarks
with significantly faster inference speed. The code is available at
http://github.com/xg416/MambaTM.

                    <h3>Joint Modeling of Spatial Dependencies Across Multiple Subjects in
  Multiplexed Tissue Imaging</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Joel Eliason, Arvind Rao, Timothy L Frankel, Michele Peruzzi</p>
                    <p>  The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a spatially heterogeneous ecosystem where
cellular interactions shape tumor progression and response to therapy.
Multiplexed imaging technologies enable high-resolution spatial
characterization of the TME, yet statistical methods for analyzing
multi-subject spatial tissue data remain limited. We propose a Bayesian
hierarchical model for inferring spatial dependencies in multiplexed imaging
datasets across multiple subjects. Our model represents the TME as a
multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process, where spatial intensity functions of
different cell types are governed by a latent multivariate Gaussian process. By
pooling information across subjects, we estimate spatial correlation functions
that capture within-type and cross-type dependencies, enabling interpretable
inference about disease-specific cellular organization. We validate our method
using simulations, demonstrating robustness to latent factor specification and
spatial resolution. We apply our approach to two multiplexed imaging datasets:
pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer, revealing distinct spatial
organization patterns across disease subtypes and highlighting tumor-immune
interactions that differentiate immune-permissive and immune-exclusive
microenvironments. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of immune
evasion and may inform novel therapeutic strategies. Our approach offers a
principled framework for modeling spatial dependencies in multi-subject data,
with broader applicability to spatially resolved omics and imaging studies. An
R package, available online, implements our methods.
