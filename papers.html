                    <h3>Equivariant Image Modeling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ruixiao Dong, Mengde Xu, Zigang Geng, Li Li, Han Hu, Shuyang Gu</p>
                    <p>  Current generative models, such as autoregressive and diffusion approaches,
decompose high-dimensional data distribution learning into a series of simpler
subtasks. However, inherent conflicts arise during the joint optimization of
these subtasks, and existing solutions fail to resolve such conflicts without
sacrificing efficiency or scalability. We propose a novel equivariant image
modeling framework that inherently aligns optimization targets across subtasks
by leveraging the translation invariance of natural visual signals. Our method
introduces (1) column-wise tokenization which enhances translational symmetry
along the horizontal axis, and (2) windowed causal attention which enforces
consistent contextual relationships across positions. Evaluated on
class-conditioned ImageNet generation at 256x256 resolution, our approach
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR models while using fewer
computational resources. Systematic analysis demonstrates that enhanced
equivariance reduces inter-task conflicts, significantly improving zero-shot
generalization and enabling ultra-long image synthesis. This work establishes
the first framework for task-aligned decomposition in generative modeling,
offering insights into efficient parameter sharing and conflict-free
optimization. The code and models are publicly available at
https://github.com/drx-code/EquivariantModeling.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Karim Abou Zeid, Kadir Yilmaz, Daan de Geus, Alexander Hermans, David Adrian, Timm Linder, Bastian Leibe</p>
                    <p>  Vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on large-scale image datasets provide
high-quality features that have significantly advanced 2D visual recognition.
However, their potential in 3D vision remains largely untapped, despite the
common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While
significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent
state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the
integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge
this trend by introducing DITR, a simple yet effective approach that extracts
2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them
into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art
results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To
enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we
further propose to distill 2D foundation models into a 3D backbone as a
pretraining task. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from
2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks,
ultimately boosting performance across various datasets.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fangfu Liu, Hanyang Wang, Yimo Cai, Kaiyan Zhang, Xiaohang Zhan, Yueqi Duan</p>
                    <p>  With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and
computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital
creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains.
Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling
to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more
inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models
through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation
model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much
can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this
work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching
problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target
video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time
verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching
process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search
strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step
denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs,
we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called
Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video
generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute
consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

                    <h3>Exploring Training and Inference Scaling Laws in Generative Retrieval</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Ruifeng Yuan, Wenjie Wang, Zhen Zhang, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua</p>
                    <p>  Generative retrieval has emerged as a novel paradigm that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to autoregressively generate document identifiers.
Although promising, the mechanisms that underpin its performance and
scalability remain largely unclear. We conduct a systematic investigation of
training and inference scaling laws in generative retrieval, exploring how
model size, training data scale, and inference-time compute jointly influence
retrieval performance. To address the lack of suitable metrics, we propose a
novel evaluation measure inspired by contrastive entropy and generation loss,
providing a continuous performance signal that enables robust comparisons
across diverse generative retrieval methods. Our experiments show that
n-gram-based methods demonstrate strong alignment with both training and
inference scaling laws, especially when paired with larger LLMs. Furthermore,
increasing inference computation yields substantial performance gains,
revealing that generative retrieval can significantly benefit from higher
compute budgets at inference. Across these settings, LLaMA models consistently
outperform T5 models, suggesting a particular advantage for larger decoder-only
models in generative retrieval. Taken together, our findings underscore that
model sizes, data availability, and inference computation interact to unlock
the full potential of generative retrieval, offering new insights for designing
and optimizing future systems.

                    <h3>Training-free Diffusion Acceleration with Bottleneck Sampling</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ye Tian, Xin Xia, Yuxi Ren, Shanchuan Lin, Xing Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Yunhai Tong, Ling Yang, Bin Cui</p>
                    <p>  Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual content
generation but remain challenging to deploy due to their high computational
cost during inference. This computational burden primarily arises from the
quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video
resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality
or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are
pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these
low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading
performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free
framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead
while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high
denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and
final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To
mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution
transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage.
We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where
extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to
3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while
maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling
process across multiple evaluation metrics. Code is available at:

                    <h3>Video SimpleQA: Towards Factuality Evaluation in Large Video Language
  Models</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Meng Cao, Pengfei Hu, Yingyao Wang, Jihao Gu, Haoran Tang, Haoze Zhao, Jiahua Dong, Wangbo Yu, Ge Zhang, Ian Reid, Xiaodan Liang</p>
                    <p>  Recent advancements in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have highlighted
their potential for multi-modal understanding, yet evaluating their factual
grounding in video contexts remains a critical unsolved challenge. To address
this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark
tailored for factuality evaluation of LVLMs. Our work distinguishes from
existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge
required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the explicit
narrative; 2) Fact-seeking question: targeting objective, undisputed events or
relationships, avoiding subjective interpretation; 3) Definitive & short-form
answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short
format, enabling automated evaluation through LLM-as-a-judge frameworks with
minimal scoring variance; 4) External-source verified: All annotations undergo
rigorous validation against authoritative external references to ensure the
reliability; 5) Temporal reasoning required: The annotated question types
encompass both static single-frame understanding and dynamic temporal
reasoning, explicitly evaluating LVLMs factuality under the long-context
dependencies. We extensively evaluate 41 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize
key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in
factual adherence, particularly for open-source models. The best-performing
model Gemini-1.5-Pro achieves merely an F-score of 54.4%; 2) Test-time compute
paradigms show insignificant performance gains, revealing fundamental
constraints for enhancing factuality through post-hoc computation; 3)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost
of additional inference time overhead, presenting a critical
efficiency-performance trade-off.

                    <h3>Causal Links Between Anthropogenic Emissions and Air Pollution Dynamics
  in Delhi</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sourish Das, Sudeep Shukla, Alka Yadav, Anirban Chakraborti</p>
                    <p>  Air pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges,
particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. Delhi-National Capital Region
experiences air pollution episodes due to complex interactions between
anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions. Understanding the causal
drivers of key pollutants such as $PM_{2.5}$ and ground $O_3$ is crucial for
developing effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates the causal
links of anthropogenic emissions on $PM_{2.5}$ and $O_3$ concentrations using
predictive modeling and causal inference techniques. Integrating
high-resolution air quality data from Jan 2018 to Aug 2023 across 32 monitoring
stations, we develop predictive regression models that incorporate
meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity), pollutant
concentrations ($NO_2, SO_2, CO$), and seasonal harmonic components to capture
both diurnal and annual cycles. Here, we show that reductions in anthropogenic
emissions lead to significant decreases in $PM_{2.5}$ levels, whereas their
effect on $O_3$ remains marginal and statistically insignificant. To address
spatial heterogeneity, we employ Gaussian Process modeling. Further, we use
Granger causality analysis and counterfactual simulation to establish direct
causal links. Validation using real-world data from the COVID-19 lockdown
confirms that reduced emissions led to a substantial drop in $PM_{2.5}$ but
only a slight, insignificant change in $O_3$. The findings highlight the
necessity of targeted emission reduction policies while emphasizing the need
for integrated strategies addressing both particulate and ozone pollution.
These insights are crucial for policymakers designing air pollution
interventions in other megacities, and offer a scalable methodology for
tackling complex urban air pollution through data-driven decision-making.

                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Akhiad Bercovich, Mohammad Dabbah, Omri Puny, Ido Galil, Amnon Geifman, Yonatan Geifman, Izhak Golan, Ehud Karpas, Itay Levy, Zach Moshe, Najeeb Nabwani, Tomer Ronen, Itamar Schen, Elad Segal, Ido Shahaf, Oren Tropp, Ran Zilberstein, Ran El-Yaniv</p>
                    <p>  We introduce FFN Fusion, an architectural optimization technique that reduces
sequential computation in large language models by identifying and exploiting
natural opportunities for parallelization. Our key insight is that sequences of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, particularly those remaining after the
removal of specific attention layers, can often be parallelized with minimal
accuracy impact. We develop a principled methodology for identifying and fusing
such sequences, transforming them into parallel operations that significantly
reduce inference latency while preserving model behavior. Applying these
techniques to Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, we create Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base
(Ultra-253B-Base), an efficient and soon-to-be publicly available model that
achieves a 1.71X speedup in inference latency and 35X lower per-token cost
while maintaining strong performance across benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments on models from 49B to 253B parameters, we demonstrate that FFN
Fusion becomes increasingly effective at larger scales and can complement
existing optimization techniques like quantization and pruning. Most
intriguingly, we find that even full transformer blocks containing both
attention and FFN layers can sometimes be parallelized, suggesting new
directions for neural architecture design.

                    <p>  Many real-world applications are increasingly incorporating automated
decision-making, driven by the widespread adoption of ML/AI inference for
planning and guidance. This study examines the growing need for verifiable
computing in autonomous decision-making. We formalize the problem of verifiable
computing and introduce a sampling-based protocol that is significantly faster,
more cost-effective, and simpler than existing methods. Furthermore, we tackle
the challenges posed by non-determinism, proposing a set of strategies to
effectively manage common scenarios.

                    <h3>xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Chi-Chih Chang, Chien-Yu Lin, Yash Akhauri, Wei-Cheng Lin, Kai-Chiang Wu, Luis Ceze, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah</p>
                    <p>  Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful
applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key
and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from
multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either
require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine
similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find
that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple
layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple
post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the
KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers
into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through
extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs
(e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates
than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%.
Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
(e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding
tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong
capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context
LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at:
