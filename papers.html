                    <h3>Text-guided Sparse Voxel Pruning for Efficient 3D Visual Grounding</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Wenxuan Guo, Xiuwei Xu, Ziwei Wang, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu</p>
                    <p>  In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-level convolution architecture
for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the
requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based
architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional
architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding
framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding
task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text
features, sparse convolution-based architecture is inefficient for this
interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose
text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D
scene representation and text features in an efficient way by gradual region
pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D
scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with
text features by cross-attention. To mitigate the affect of pruning on delicate
geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel
completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous
single-stage methods, our method achieves top inference speed and surpasses
previous fastest method by 100\% FPS. Our method also achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy even compared with two-stage methods, with $+1.13$ lead of Acc@0.5 on
ScanRefer, and $+2.6$ and $+3.2$ leads on NR3D and SR3D respectively. The code

                    <h3>Representation and Interpretation in Artificial and Natural Computing</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Luis A. Pineda</p>
                    <p>  Artificial computing machinery transforms representations through an
objective process, to be interpreted subjectively by humans, so the machine and
the interpreter are different entities, but in the putative natural computing
both processes are performed by the same agent. The method or process that
transforms a representation is called here \emph{the mode of computing}. The
mode used by digital computers is the algorithmic one, but there are others,
such as quantum computers and diverse forms of non-conventional computing, and
there is an open-ended set of representational formats and modes that could be
used in artificial and natural computing. A mode based on a notion of computing
different from Turing's may perform feats beyond what the Turing Machine does
but the modes would not be of the same kind and could not be compared. For a
mode of computing to be more powerful than the algorithmic one, it ought to
compute functions lacking an effective algorithm, and Church Thesis would not
hold. Here, a thought experiment including a computational demon using a
hypothetical mode for such an effect is presented. If there is natural
computing, there is a mode of natural computing whose properties may be causal
to the phenomenological experience. Discovering it would come with solving the
hard problem of consciousness; but if it turns out that such a mode does not
exist, there is no such thing as natural computing, and the mind is not a
computational process.

                    <h3>Scalar weak gravity bound from full unitarity</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Tokareva, Yongjun Xu</p>
                    <p>  Weak gravity conjecture can be formulated as a statement that gravity must be
the weakest force, compared to the other interactions in low energy effective
field theory (EFT). Several arguments in favor of this statement were presented
from the side of string theory and black hole physics. However, it is still an
open question whether the statement of weak gravity can be proven based on more
general assumptions of causality, unitarity, and locality of the fundamental
theory. These consistency requirements imply the dispersion relations for the
scattering amplitudes which allow to bound the EFT coefficients. The main
difficulty for obtaining these constraints in the presence of gravity is
related to the graviton pole which makes the required dispersion relations
divergent in the forward limit. In this work, we present a new way of deriving
the bound on the ratio between the EFT cutoff scale and Planck mass from
confronting the IR divergences from graviton pole and one-loop running of the
EFT Wilson coefficient in front of the dimension-12 operator. Our method also
allows the incorporation of full unitarity of partial wave expansion of the UV
theory. We examine the EFT of a single shift-symmetric scalar in four
dimensions and find that the maximal value of the cutoff scale of the EFT
coupled to gravity must be lower than about $O(10)$ Planck mass.

                    <h3>Agentic Verification for Ambiguous Query Disambiguation</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang, Ruofan Wu, Feng Yan, Danmei Xu, Moutasem Akkad, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He</p>
                    <p>  In this work, we tackle the challenge of disambiguating queries in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to diverse yet answerable interpretations.
State-of-the-arts follow a Diversify-then-Verify (DtV) pipeline, where diverse
interpretations are generated by an LLM, later used as search queries to
retrieve supporting passages. Such a process may introduce noise in either
interpretations or retrieval, particularly in enterprise settings, where LLMs
-- trained on static data -- may struggle with domain-specific disambiguations.
Thus, a post-hoc verification phase is introduced to prune noises. Our
distinction is to unify diversification with verification by incorporating
feedback from retriever and generator early on. This joint approach improves
both efficiency and robustness by reducing reliance on multiple retrieval and
inference steps, which are susceptible to cascading errors. We validate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our method, Verified-Diversification with
Consolidation (VERDICT), on the widely adopted ASQA benchmark to achieve
diverse yet verifiable interpretations. Empirical results show that VERDICT
improves grounding-aware F1 score by an average of 23% over the strongest
baseline across different backbone LLMs.

                    <h3>STAR: Spectral Truncation and Rescale for Model Merging</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yu-Ang Lee, Ching-Yun Ko, Tejaswini Pedapati, I-Hsin Chung, Mi-Yen Yeh, Pin-Yu Chen</p>
                    <p>  Model merging is an efficient way of obtaining a multi-task model from
several pretrained models without further fine-tuning, and it has gained
attention in various domains, including natural language processing (NLP).
Despite the efficiency, a key challenge in model merging is the seemingly
inevitable decrease in task performance as the number of models increases. In
this paper, we propose $\mathbf{S}$pectral $\mathbf{T}$runcation $\mathbf{A}$nd
$\mathbf{R}$escale (STAR) that aims at mitigating ``merging conflicts'' by
truncating small components in the respective spectral spaces, which is
followed by an automatic parameter rescaling scheme to retain the nuclear norm
of the original matrix. STAR requires no additional inference on original
training data and is robust to hyperparamater choice. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of STAR through extensive model merging cases on diverse NLP
tasks. Specifically, STAR works robustly across varying model sizes, and can
outperform baselines by 4.2$\%$ when merging 12 models on Flan-T5. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/IBM/STAR.

                    <h3>Many-body theory calculations of positron binding to parabenzoquinone</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> S. K. Gregg, J. Hofierka, B. Cunningham, D. G. Green</p>
                    <p>  Positron binding in parabenzoquinone is studied using \textit{ab initio}
many-body theory. The effects of electron-positron correlations including
polarization, virtual positronium formation and positron-hole repulsion, as
well as those of $\pi$ bonds, aromaticity, and lone electron pairs, are
considered. The binding energy is calculated as 60$\pm$16 meV, considerably
larger than the 0.0925 meV value inferred from recent scattering calculations
of [G. Moreira and M. Bettega, {\emph{Eur.~Phys.~J.~D}} {\bf 78} (2024)], but
substantially smaller than we find in benzene (148$\pm$26 meV). The positron
contact density (lifetime) is calculated as 8.0$\times10^{-3}$ a.u. (2.48 ns),
vs.~1.61$\times 10^{-2}$ a.u. (0.81 ns) in benzene. The decrease (increase) in
binding (annihilation rate) in parabenzoquinone compared to benzene is ascribed
to the loss of aromaticity: the electron density on the positive oxygen nuclei
being relatively harder for the positron to probe compared to the aromatic
rings in benzene.

                    <h3>A Mechanistic Framework for Collider Detection in Observational Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Soumik Purkayastha, Peter X. -K. Song</p>
                    <p>  Understanding directionality is crucial for identifying causal structures
from observational data. A key challenge lies in detecting collider structures,
where a $V$--structure is formed between a child node $Z$ receiving directed
edges from parents $X$ and $Y$, denoted by $X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y$.
Traditional causal discovery approaches, such as constraint-based and
score-based structure learning algorithms, do not provide statistical inference
on estimated pathways and are often sensitive to latent confounding. To
overcome these issues, we introduce methodology to quantify directionality in
collider structures using a pair of conditional asymmetry coefficients to
simultaneously examine validity of the pathways $Y \rightarrow Z$ and $X
\rightarrow Z$ in the collider structure. These coefficients are based on
Shannon's differential entropy. Leveraging kernel-based conditional density
estimation and a nonparametric smoothing technique, we utilise our proposed
method to estimate collider structures and provide uncertainty quantification.
  Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing structure
learning algorithms in accurately identifying collider structures. We further
apply our approach to investigate the role of blood pressure as a collider in
epigenetic DNA methylation, uncovering novel insights into the genetic
regulation of blood pressure. This framework represents a significant
advancement in causal structure learning, offering a robust, nonparametric
method for collider detection with practical applications in biostatistics and
epidemiology.

                    <h3>DeltaProduct: Increasing the Expressivity of DeltaNet Through Products
  of Householders</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Julien Siems, Timur Carstensen, Arber Zela, Frank Hutter, Massimiliano Pontil, Riccardo Grazzi</p>
                    <p>  Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive
alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training
and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental
trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of
their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures
like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited
expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet
and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous
token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a
slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of
DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per
token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead
takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus
rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized
Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance
expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking
and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved
length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the
theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve
dihedral group word problems in just two layers.

                    <h3>A Latent Causal Inference Framework for Ordinal Variables</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Martina Scauda, Jack Kuipers, Giusi Moffa</p>
                    <p>  Ordinal variables, such as on the Likert scale, are common in applied
research. Yet, existing methods for causal inference tend to target nominal or
continuous data. When applied to ordinal data, this fails to account for the
inherent ordering or imposes well-defined relative magnitudes. Hence, there is
a need for specialised methods to compute interventional effects between
ordinal variables while accounting for their ordinality. One potential
framework is to presume a latent Gaussian Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model:
that the ordinal variables originate from marginally discretizing a set of
Gaussian variables whose latent covariance matrix is constrained to satisfy the
conditional independencies inherent in a DAG. Conditioned on a given latent
covariance matrix and discretisation thresholds, we derive a closed-form
function for ordinal causal effects in terms of interventional distributions in
the latent space. Our causal estimation combines naturally with algorithms to
learn the latent DAG and its parameters, like the Ordinal Structural EM
algorithm. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach
in estimating ordinal causal effects both for known and unknown structures of
the latent graph. As an illustration of a real-world use case, the method is
applied to survey data of 408 patients from a study on the functional
relationships between symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.

                    <h3>An overview of what current data can (and cannot yet) say about evolving
  dark energy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> William Giarè, Tariq Mahassen, Eleonora Di Valentino, Supriya Pan</p>
                    <p>  Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and distance moduli
from Type Ia supernovae suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE)
scenarios characterized by a time-varying equation of state (EoS). This focused
review assesses its robustness across independent measurements and surveys.
Using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization to describe the
evolution of the DE EoS, we analyze over 35 dataset combinations, incorporating
Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, three independent Type
Ia supernova (SN) catalogs (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5), BAO measurements from
DESI and SDSS, and expansion rate measurements $H(z)$ inferred from the
relative ages of massive, passively evolving galaxies at early cosmic times
known as Cosmic Chronometers (CC). This review has two main objectives: first,
to evaluate the statistical significance of the DDE preference across different
dataset combinations, which incorporate varying sources of information.
Specifically, we consider cases where only low-redshift probes are used in
different combinations, others where individual low-redshift probes are
analyzed together with CMB data, and finally, scenarios where high- and
low-redshift probes are included in all possible independent combinations.
Second, we provide a reader-friendly synthesis of what the latest cosmological
and astrophysical probes can (and cannot yet) reveal about DDE. Overall, our
findings highlight that combinations that \textit{simultaneously} include
PantheonPlus SN and SDSS BAO significantly weaken the preference for DDE.
However, intriguing hints supporting DDE emerge in combinations that do not
include DESI-BAO measurements: SDSS-BAO combined with SN from Union3 and DESY5
(with and without CMB) support the preference for DDE.
